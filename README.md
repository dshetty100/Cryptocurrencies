# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the cryptocurrecy dataset (crypto_data.csv) and create a report that shows what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio that is being offered by an investment bank for its customers.

The analysis uses unsupervised machine learning to examine cryptocurrency data

The analysis was carried out in following steps:
* The data was first preprocessed by cleaning, encoding, and scaling it  to fit the machine learning model algorithm. 
* Using the preprocessed data, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm was used to reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame, pcs_df.
* The K-means algorithm was then used to create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame. The K-means algorithm was run to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

* Finally, the data was visualized using a 3D scatter plot.

The data was also transformed for "Total Coin Supply" and "Total Coins Mined" to create a 2D scatter plot.
